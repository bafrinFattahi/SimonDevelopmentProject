<h2 class="content__headline">Careers in computing: how I worked my way into the industry</h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>My background</strong>

In my primary school, the idea of ICT or computing classes was pretty much non-existent. My own interest in computers was only sparked by an inquisitiveness to see what they were capable of and what I could get them to do. I soon realised that this was the path I wanted to follow and continued to explore various software packages in my free time right through secondary school.

The dull nature of ICT teaching in schools pushed me to opt for the advanced GNVQ ICT qualification that my school offered as an alternative to standard GCSE ICT. The GNVQ qualification was much more appropriate for our age range as it included interesting content such as basic web design and databases. For my A-levels, I commuted for an hour twice daily to attend a sixth form college that offered a computing A-level.

This A-level was the first exposure I'd had to actual computer programming and further captured my interest in the subject. I went on to study computer science at the University of Warwick. In the second and third years of my degree we worked on substantial software engineering projects that are of keen interest to potential employers. I also undertook a small amount of work experience at a software company in Hertfordshire. This experience helped me to eventually secure an internship place at an investment bank for the summer before my final year, which led to an offer of a grad scheme place when I graduate.
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>My feelings on the future job m</b><b>arket</b><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37" src="http://homepages.shu.ac.uk/~b6021259/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/HOME.png" alt="" width="460" height="276" /></h3>
Computing as a discipline has always been a keen interest of mine and it was always the subject I intended to study at university. It was a happy coincidence then when I found out that Computer Science graduates are among the most sought-after of any degree subject.

As every aspect of business and commerce becomes ever more reliant on computing, the demand for technologically minded individuals is increasing at a huge rate. This is great for current computer science students such as myself, as we're entering the industry at a very exciting and lucrative time. Despite this boom in technology-reliant business, I can see a time where the expansion of this area slows and the cohort of students starting the new digital literacy initiative may actually find it more difficult to find a job.

Currently, the key to acquiring the holy grail of a well-paid grad scheme place is experience: temporary jobs at small companies, freelance work, internships or just interesting personal projects are all sought after by potential employers, and are what currently set apart graduates fighting for competitive places. In 10-plus years time when the next generation of computing graduates hit the job market, the competition is going to be much more fierce. The nature of the IT industry means that new skills must be continually acquired to keep up with the trends.

This won't be a problem for the established employees of today as there are a limited number of people with the basic skills required to adapt, but it may be more of an issue for the graduates of tomorrow, who will all have the same basic grounding in computer science and will all be able to adapt to trends much more easily. This will create a much more free-flowing stream of talented, young technologists at a time when technology-centric jobs are starting to become less specialised.

My job role is global technology analyst at a Barclays Capital. I believe the key to me getting the role wasn't directly based on my computer science background â€“ there were a number of other interns from other academic backgrounds (maths, physics, engineering and so on) who also got offered places.

For investment banking in particular, I believe they were more interested in experience and adaptability than current skills. Many of the interns mentioned above had never learned computer programming, but demonstrated the competencies and versatility required to learn the skills they needed for the job.

So, whereas my personal case may have relied heavily on my experience and past work, it need not be the case for all applicants. I have to say though, I think what employers look for in banking technology roles is different to what a "pure" IT company would look for. They would be much more interested in a firm grounding in computer science principles and personal projects that can effectively demonstrate their programming skills, as well as "soft skills" such as teamwork, communication, assertiveness and so on.

The need to replace the current ICT curriculum is a natural progression given the pace at which everyday technologies are advancing. The old curriculum taught basic skills such as word processing, which most current primary-level children will already be competent with, and are now merely complementary tools to every kind of work and study. As basic word processing and spreadsheet skills are now an expected requirement for even the most basic of jobs, basic programming skills will become a basic requirement in the future. This means that computer science graduates will have to work extra hard and possess even more advanced skills in order to compete with applicants from any background or subject area.

Another effect of the initiative will hopefully be to address the alarming gender balance problem in pretty much every major technology company in the world. Computer science and related subjects are vastly male-dominated due to its "geeky" portrayal and the way maths and sciences are taught in schools. If the new curriculum is taught properly, it should make all science related subjects a lot more accessible and hopefully dispel some of the apparent taboos associated with women in technology.

The new campaign is an exciting and necessary revolution in the way technology and computing is perceived from a young age, but if it is as successful as we all hope, it could potentially make life even harder for the next generation of science graduates.
